IndividualProjectsSetC

Summary: 
This page allows users to submit a search request with an artist's name and renders their bio, date formed and genre back. It further allows the user to save the search and display it on the search page.

Important: 
The node_modules folder is missing here, but it can be found in the zipped folder. 
This was one of the individual project I worked on which required html, javascript, css, node.js, docker, postgres and sql. 

It is not fully finished.
